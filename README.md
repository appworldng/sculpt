A simple e-commerce theme using TailWind CSS.

To use:

1. Clone the repository:

   cd sculpt
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Using Yarn
   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   # Using npm

   ```

   Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:8080.

4. Open `public/index.html` in your editor and start experimenting!

To build an optimized version of your CSS, simply run:
